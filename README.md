Template matching is an image processing technique which is used to find the location of small-parts/template of a large image. This technique is widely used for object detection projects, like product quality, vehicle tracking, robotics etc. 
In this article, we will learn how to use template matching for detecting the related fields in a document image.
Solution: 
Above task can be achieved using template matching. Clip out the field images and apply template matching using clipped field images and the document image. The algorithm is simple yet reproducible into complex versions to solve the problem of field detection and localization for document images belonging to specific domains.
